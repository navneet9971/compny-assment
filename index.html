                Investing in your dream home is one of the most crucial decisions of your life. This is precisely why
                your research should be thorough before you get into a long-term repayment commitment with a lender.

            <p class="seventh-main-para">In this video, we are going to talk about the process of availing a home loan.
                As a homebuyer, you should know where this process comes in place in the entire home buying journey,
                what is a loan application and how should you fill it, when and how to negotiate, thus giving you an
                entire roadmap on the process of availing a home loan so that you can save both time and money.
            </p>


            <p class="seventh-main-custom-title">
                Step 1: Finalise the property
            </p>

            <p class="seventh-main-custom-para">There are two types of property that you can buy- ready-to-move and
                under-construction. In both cases, loan agreement and loan disbursal stage, which are the final step,
                varies slightly. We’ll talk about it when we come to it. In the first stage, if you are not buying the
                property with 100% cash, you will require a home loan. So, finalise your property and get set for loan
                shopping.
            </p>


            <p class="seventh-main-custom-title">
                Step 2: Filling up loan application
            </p>

            <div class="step-2-custom-para">
                <p class="step-2-custom-first">
                    Once you have finalised the property, homebuyers need to fill a loan application. Homebuyers should
                    enquire about various offers, home loan interest rates, documents required at this stage. At this
                    stage, you can also negotiate the processing fee with the bank.
                </p>

                <p class="step-2-custom-para-second">
                    You can start a loan inquiry. For this, you should start comparing interest rates online. This is
                    the easiest way to understand the bank that will provide you the best and lowest home loan interest
                    rate. You can also find all the details on the dedicated home loan page on Housing.com. Post this,
                    you can directly generate an inquiry with the bank either by approaching the nearest bank branch or
                    using the bank’s website.
                </p>

                <p class="step-2-custom-para-third">
                    During the inquiry, you can negotiate for the best available rates. Many homebuyers do not know that
                    the home loan interest rate is negotiable. On the basis of your good credit score and income, banks
                    can give you a good interest rate as well. So be aware and ask for it at this stage before it's too
                    late.
                </p>

                <p class="step-2-custom-para-fourth">
                    At this stage, you should also know that an additional expenditure also comes in the form of
                    processing fee which can be anywhere up to 1% of your loan amount. This is also negotiable and most
                    banks will agree for anything between 0.25-0.5% of the loan amount as processing fee.
                </p>

                <p class="step-2-custom-para-fifth">
                    You will also have to pay a fee for due diligence that the bank will do for you. It may happen that
                    banks lower the processing fee but ask you for a higher charge for due diligence. It is important
                    that you clarify this early on, to avoid spending more than what your budget permits.
                </p>

                <p class="step-2-custom-para-six">
                    The next step is related to documents. Salaried and self-employed borrowers need to provide separate
                    documents to the bank so that the bank can assess the financial health of the homebuyer. You can
                    refer to the list below. Some of the common documents included are as follows. You can keep these
                    ready whenever you proceed to apply for a home loan. Remember that you should pay the processing fee
                    only to the bank that you feel is giving the best interest rate.

                Step 3: Bank's due diligence
            </p>

            <div class="step-3-main-paragraph">
                <p>
                    Banks will not give you a home loan without assessing your financial background, your repaying
                    capacity, the legality of the property, and other details based on their field investigation. This
                    is the next step where the bank does due diligence.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Your bank statements, savings, transactions, investments, business activity, credit and repayments,
                    bank balance, cheque bounces - all these are studied by the bank. Now suppose that your cheques have
                    bounced or been returned in the past- this can lead to ineligibility to get a home loan. The bank
                    also studies your liabilities and loans.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After this, the bank sees your net income and credit score. A score of 750 and above indicates a
                    healthy credit score and banks are usually willing to give you a better (lower) interest rate.
                </p>

                <p>

                    Not just financial health, banks also check your personal details through a field investigation
                    where they check your residential address and contact details. A bank representative may visit your
                    home to confirm such details. Do note that the nature and sector of your job also impact and
                    determines whether you are eligible for a home loan. For example, sectors where there is a risk of
                    job loss or instability, high attrition, are often not considered good. The field representative
                    usually determines this.
                </p>

                <p>

                    The property that you are going to buy is also checked. The property’s condition, quality,
                    encroachments, valuation- all these aspects are checked by the bank. If the property is under
                    construction, then the construction progress, its quality, building plan, and layout are also
                    carefully examined. This is the technical due-diligence stage.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Next is the legal due diligence stage. Ownership and encumbrance related documents are checked. In
                    the case of unestablished ownership or a third party’s claim on the property, banks do not approve
                    of the home loan. This is also one of the reasons why taking a home loan is beneficial in many ways.
                    Banks check the entire title deed, possession certificate, sale agreement, etc. It will help you
                    make an informed decision. Even in the case of an under-construction property, banks study and
                    examine land ownership, allotment letters, builder-buyer agreement, project approval documents, etc.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p class="step-4-main-title">
                Step 4: Estimating your creditworthiness and loan eligibility
            </p>


            <div class="step-4-main-paragraph">
                <p>
                    Once banks establish that the property you are interested in is sound and free of legal hassles, it
                    does a deep-dive into your creditworthiness. For this, banks study your repayment history and check
                    for defaults. You can even get a higher loan amount in case you have been able to maintain a good
                    credit score, throughout.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At this stage, banks assess your EMI repayment capacity based on your income and liabilities, if
                    any. For example, Amit has an income of Rs 50,000 per month and a car loan liability of Rs 10,000
                    per month. The total disposable income of Amit is Rs 40,000 per month. Banks consider it good if
                    your EMI is not more than 50% of your disposable income. In this case, therefore, Amit can spend Rs
                    20,000 per maximum as EMI, and therefore, the home loan sanctioned may roughly be between Rs 20-25
                    lakh. It depends on different banks, how they assess and calculate your repayment capacity. In
                    short, banks check the Loan to Value ratio and do not sanction more than 80-90 %. It also checks
                    your income, age, company, nature of work, etc to calculate your home loan eligibility.
                </p>

            </div>


            <p class="step-4-main-title">
                Step 5: Accepting the offer letter
            </p>

            <div class="step-5-paragraph">
                <p>
                    After various checks, the bank sends you an offer letter with the final loan amount mentioned in it.
                    If you sign, it is considered as accepted formally. You can then sign the loan agreement. After
                    this, the bank hands over the DD to the seller and you can take possession of the property.

                </p>

                <p>
                    The offer letter clearly mentions the sanctioned loan amount, rate of interest- whether fixed or
                    variable. Fixed interest rates are higher than variable but even fixed is not altogether a fixed
                    rate, these could be floating rates as well and could be fixed for a certain period. It totally
                    depends on you whether you choose, fixed and floating rate or variable. The offer letter also
                    mentions the tenure, number of EMIs to be paid, mode of repayment whether post-dated cheques or
                    electronic clearing; schemes availed such as PMAY or bank offers, validity, terms, and conditions,
                    etc. You should sign the offer letter only if you are satisfied with the offer. Do remember to check
                    the sanctioned amount.
                </p>

                <p>

                    Pro Tip: If you can arrange some finances from friends and family, you can also ask the bank to
                    reduce the loan amount sanctioned.
                </p>

                <p>

                    The next step is the loan agreement. All borrowers need to sign it in case of a joint home loan. If
                    you have planned to opt for post-dated cheques as repayment option, banks collect cheques equivalent
                    to the loan amount at this stage, for security.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the case of an under-construction property, the process is slightly different. A tripartite
                    agreement is signed at this stage between the bank, borrower, and builder.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The loan disbursement stage for an under-construction property is different and depends on the
                    progress of construction. Accordingly, the bank pays the builder directly and all the original
                    documents are collected from you by the bank.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The sale deed is signed in the case of a ready-to-move property. The day it is signed, the DD is
                    directly handed over to the seller. Prior to this, the bank will check whether you have made any
                    down payment and whether the sale deed has been registered at the sub-registrar’s office. Even in
                    ready-to-move property, banks keep all the original property papers. Do keep photocopies of all the
                    documents that you have submitted in the bank.

                    the creditworthiness of a customer to avail and repay a particular loan amount. Home loan
                    eligibility depends on criteria such as age, financial position, credit history, credit score, other

                    The lender has to assess your financial health before it decides that you are mortgage worthy.
                    Further, it's a sizable amount to be repaid over the long term by you and the lender must know that
                    you will be able to service your loan diligently through the tenure.

                    In order to judge your credit worthiness, your prospective lender will therefore ask you to submit a

                    When you are comparing lenders and checking out home loan options, you should not only look at
                    interest rate comparisons but also the various other fees and charges. Some of these charges need to
                    be paid upfront while you are taking the loan while other charges are levied during the tenure of
                    your loan. While negotiating with lenders, you should have a clear idea about the various other
                    charges so that you can negotiate well and get the maximum benefits. Here is a checklist on charges

                    A lender needs proof to establish your repayment capability. For this, it will take a thorough
                    look not just as your income statements but also your assets and liabilities and your credit
                    history.

                <p>
                    The standard method banks use to assess your home loan eligibility is the application of FOIR (fixed
                    obligation to income ratio) of a borrower. To calculate the FOIR, the lender takes into
                    consideration all the other monthly instalments a borrower is paying including the home loan that he
                    has applied for. However, the statutory deductions from your salary like provident fund, insurance
                    premium payments are not taken into consideration in this calculation.

                <p>
                    Suppose the income of a prospective borrower is Rs 50,000 per month.

                <p>
                    He pays a car loan EMI of Rs 8,000 per month

                <p>
                    He has just bought a gadget and pays an EMI of Rs 2,000 per month for the same
                </p>

                    His proposed housing loan installment is Rs 15,000 per month
                </p>

                <p>
                    When all his loan installments are divided by his monthly income, the FOIR is 50% or Rs 25,000
                </p>

                <p>
                    Most lenders restrict the FOIR limit to a maximum of 50% of one's monthly income. It means that if
                    one needs around 50% of his income to meet his personal expenses, the other half is committed
                    towards fulfilling his fixed obligations, including the home loan.

            <p class="step-sub-paragraph">
                It is very important to understand and estimate your budget before you finalise on your property. It is
                equally important to think of how you are going to finance your purchase. Would you be using your
                savings or would you prefer to go the home loan way? Most people also choose the mid-way, that is, using
                some amount of your savings and some amount as a loan to finance the property. Any of these solutions
                work well for a homebuyer. However, most people do opt for home loans. One of the benefits of opting for
                a home loan is that you can preserve your liquidity.
            </p>

            <p class="step-sub-paragraph-2">
                What are the benefits of taking a home loan? For one, it is the cheapest loan available. But, the catch
                is that everyone is not eligible for a home loan! Home loan eligibility depends not only on your salary
                but other factors as well which we are going to discuss in this video.
            </p>

            <p class="step-sub-paragraph-3">
                What is the logic behind banks calculating your home loan eligibility? Banks study your repayment
                capacity before they roll out a loan for you. Suppose you are someone earning a lakh per month. A bank
                will calculate with the logic that 50% of the income is spent on personal and other expenses while the
                other 50% can be your savings or go into an investment.

                <p>
                    How to calculate home loan eligibility
                </p>

                <p>
                    Calculating your home loan eligibility is simple with this formula:
                </p>

                <p>
                    (Monthly fixed income * 50%)- other EMI payments/ EMI per lakh. This gives you the loan eligibility
                    amount in lakh.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Note that per lakh EMI varies depending upon the tenure of repayment that you choose. You will also
                    be provided with an EMI chart which will clearly show you your monthly repayment over the years. For
                    example, assuming that home loan interest is at 10.5% and the amount of loan is Rs 1 lakh, then your
                    monthly EMI is as shown here:
                </p>

                    Factors that determine your home loan eligibility
                </p>
                <p>

                    You would have clearly understood that your take-home salary is one of the top determinants to
                    calculate your home loan eligibility. Let's look at some quantitative factors too:
                </p>
            </div>


            <section class="step-13-ol-group">
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Loan to value ratio:</h3>
                    <li>
                        <p>Banks generally do not grant more than 80 per cent of the value of property as loan. This is
                            called loan to value ratio. In short, if you are interested in buying a property worth Rs 1
                            crore, the loan sanctioned will not be more than Rs 80 lakh. So how would you pay the rest
                            of the Rs 20 lakh? This is where downpayment comes into the picture. Down Payment means you
                            will have to pay the remainder from your pocket!</p>
                    </li>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Loan tenure:</h3>
                    <li>
                        <p>If you are opting for a long repayment tenure, there are chances you would be better
                            positioned to avail a home loan. When the EMI burden is spread over a long tenure, the EMI
                            is lower. Not just the tenure of loan repayment, your age will also matter! If you are 45,
                            your working age is merely 15 more years and therefore your repayment can only be over the
                            next 15 years. But suppose you are 25 -- you can spread your EMI burden over a longer
                            period, that is 30 years and therefore higher chances of being eligible for a home loan.</p>
                    </li>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Interest rate:</h3>
                    <li>
                        <p>This is a top concern among all potential home buyers who are hunting for the right loans.
                            Cheaper loans mean you have better chances of being eligible for a home loan and therefore
                            you will find many praying for a pocket-friendly interest rate!</p>
                    </li>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Other EMIs:</h3>
                    <li>
                        <p>Are you paying other EMIs such as education loan or vehicle loan? Higher EMI outflows lower
                            your chances of being eligible.</p>
                    </li>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Credit history:</h3>
                    <li>
                        <p>Your credit score is also important as it provides a look into your transaction and repayment
                            history. If your credit score shows that you have defaulted, there is no chance you'll be
                            eligible for a loan! So keep your score healthy. A score above 700 is considered good!</p>
                    </li>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Your qualifications:</h3>
                    <li>
                        <p>Your educational qualification, work experience, growth prospects, and stability are also
                            equally important. Those who have professional degrees may be treated with better interest
                            rates and may have a better chance at securing a home loan. Similarly, if you are working in
                            a coveted field, you stand a good chance. Besides, your employer's reputation is also
                            considered. Bigger companies promise lower interest rates!</p>
                    </li>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Family and work background:</h3>
                    <li>
                        <p>Can your family and background help your home loan eligibility? Banks categorize certain
                            sectors as risky, for example, the BPOs. Apart from this, jobs or sectors where layoffs and
                            attrition are high are also not given much consideration when it comes to eligibility. But
                            suppose your family background is impressive and your family members are professionals -
                            these details help banks assess your repayment capacity.</p>
                    </li>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Spending habits:</h3>
                    <li>
                        <p>Do you live life king size? This may not be good news for your bank. If you are someone used
                            to spending a lot or have many dependents on you, you are a risky customer for the bank.</p>
                    </li>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Type of property:</h3>
                    <li>
                        <p>Type of property also determines your eligibility. In case of a ready-to-move property, you
                            may get a loan, but in case of an under-construction property, loan roll out is dependent on
                            the stage of construction. If you are looking to buy a property with a general power of
                            attorney, bad news, because banks usually do not prefer financing such properties.</p>

                        You might have already checked whether or not you are eligible for a home loan. The good news is
                        there are ways to enhance your eligibility. Consider these quicks tips:
                    </p>

                    <ul class="step-14-ul">
                        <li>
                            Add a Joint applicant (spouse, blood relations) to show a higher joint income, hence better
                            chance to avail a home loan.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Add other incomes - yearly bonus, rent from property, FD interest. Remember to show proof of
                            these incomes as well.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Opt for a longer repayment tenure.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Consider paying off all the other EMIs before applying for a home loan. This will give you
                            more disposable income.
